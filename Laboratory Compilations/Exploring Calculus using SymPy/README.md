# Laboratory 4: Exploring Calculus with SymPy  
**Course:** COSC 110 â€“ Introduction to Computing  
**Lab Title:** Symbolic Calculus with Python and SymPy  

## Objective
In this lab, we explored basic calculus concepts using the SymPy library in Python. The goal was to understand how symbolic computation works and how it can help us solve math problems more efficiently.

## Topics Covered

###  Symbol Manipulation
- Learned how to create and combine symbolic variables using SymPy.

###  Limits
- Used `limit()` to find the behavior of functions near certain values.

###  Derivatives
- Calculated derivatives of basic functions to understand how they change.

###  Series Expansion
- Generated truncated Taylor series and discussed each term, including Big-O notation.

###  Solving Equations
- Solved equations symbolically (without using numbers) using SymPy tools.

###  Reflection
- Reflected on what we learned, which parts we liked most, and how SymPy helps connect algebra with calculus.

## Summary
This lab helped us apply calculus in Python using SymPy. We practiced symbolic math, explored how functions behave, and used tools that are useful in higher-level math and programming.
