# Laboratory 3: Introduction to Symbolic Computation with SymPy  
**Course:** COSC 110 â€“ Introduction to Computing  
**Lab Title:** Basic Symbolic Computation Using SymPy  

## Objective
In this lab, we explored how to work with algebraic expressions in Python using the SymPy library. The goal was to get comfortable with symbolic math and how to represent, simplify, and manipulate equations programmatically.

## Activities Overview

###  Environment Setup
- Imported SymPy modules to start using symbolic computation features.

###  Basic Calculations
- Performed operations on fractions and square roots without converting to decimals.
- Everything was kept in exact symbolic form.

###  Symbol Definition & Equation Building
- Defined variables like `x` and `y` as symbols.
- Used those symbols to create algebraic expressions and equations.

###  Expression Simplification
- Used SymPy functions to simplify complicated rational and polynomial expressions.

###  Polynomial Expansion
- Expanded expressions like binomials and squared terms into standard polynomial form.

## Summary
This lab gave us practice with symbolic algebra in Python. We learned how to define and simplify expressions, which helps prepare us for more advanced math topics like calculus and equation solving using code.
